# GPT-4o Car Vision Sample

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the use of AzureOpenAI's GPT-4o model to generate a comprehensive natural language description of a car.

The demo covers the following:

- Multi-modal capabilities (text and vision for now, speech is coming to GPT-4o soon)
- Computer vision - extracting the features of a car from an uploaded photo
- Output using JSON Mode for consistency and accuracy
- Natural language text summarisation using different prompts
- (Optional) RAG based on the response from the [DVLA VES API (third-party API, free API key available from GOV.UK on request)](https://developer-portal.driver-vehicle-licensing.api.gov.uk/apis/vehicle-enquiry-service/vehicle-enquiry-service-description.html)
